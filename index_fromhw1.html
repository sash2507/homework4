			Ten years ago, I moved from Minnesota to a little corner of Brooklyn called Cobble Hill, an historic italian neighborhood in south-east Brooklyn, just across the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. Cobble Hill  is a community of small, local shops, cafes, bakeries, bars, brownstones and leafy streets with lots of old-world charm. This webpage shows what I love most about my neighborhood. Come hang out with me sometime!
